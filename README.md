# MyTrello

## ToDo

* Make the API `RESTful`
* Improve error handling
* Replace exceptions with `Fluent Result`
* Implement `Clean Architecture`

## Questions

* Can you share DTO's between requests?
* Do you need dedicated objects for requests, responses?
* Should they be completely separated from the entities & their dto's?

## Ideas

* Containerize with docker and add SQL server in container
